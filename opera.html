        <p>DAME -          
            Warders are ye?
            Whom do ye ward?
       Warders are ye?
            Whom do ye ward?
       Bolt, bar, and key,
            Shackle and cord,
       Fetter and chain,
            Dungeon and stone,
       All are in vain—
            Prisoner's flown!
       Spite of ye all, he is free— he is free!
        Whom do ye ward? Pretty warders are ye!</p>
        <p>MEN -           
            Up and down, and in and out,
            Here and there, and round about;
            Ev'ry chamber, ev'ry house,
            Ev'ry chink that holds a mouse,
            Ev'ry crevice in the keep,
            Where a beetle black could creep,
            Ev'ry outlet, ev'ry drain,
            Have we searched, but all in vain, all in vain.</p>
        
        <p> WILFRED-   Aye, it's well for thee to laugh. Thou hast a good
            post, and hast cause to be merry.</p>
        <p>POINT-    
             Difficult? Nothing easier. Nothing easier. Attend, and
                I will prove it to thee!
    
           No. 14. Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon</p>
        <p>FAIRFAX -  Well, Sergeant Meryll, and how fares thy pretty
            charge,Elsie Maynard</p>
        <p>MERYLL -   Well enough, sir. She is quite strong again, and
                leaves us to-night.</p>
        <P>ELSIE -    Master Leonard!
        </P>
